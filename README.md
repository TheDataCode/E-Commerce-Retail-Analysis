### E-COMMERCE SALES ANALYSIS


An analysis of an e-commerce store that ships to 38 countries, using one yearâ€™s worth of purchase data recorded in US dollars. The goal is to uncover key business insights, including identifying the highest revenue-generating customers, the top and bottom-performing countries, and overall sales trends throughout the year. It also examines the relationship between the number of items purchased and total revenue, using hypothesis testing to determine statistical significance. Additionally, the project explores whether there is a significant difference in average sales between countries.
